# OpenAi-Atari
Building a model to play Atari Breakout game from Open AI.

In this Notebook, I have build a RL model using the framework stable-baseline which is a set of improved implementations of Reinforcement Learning (RL) algorithms based on OpenAI Baselines. I have build the Model using A2C Algorithm and applied CNN policy.
